# CBOS-shell
A shell I made in python with a install .exe file and source code.
Note that the code will exit when the install program finishes on windows and if you want to run it off cmd you need to install python 3 I programed it on python 3.12 so i know that it works on 3.12.
All the stuff i told you up there ONLY applies to windows because i know that linux has python built in.
I recomend just downloading the whole zip file because if you need the install.exe you need the code.txt file and if you need the install(no password) then you need the code(npass).txt.
Also the the CBOS shell in the folder is a .py file.
finally when you run the .exe/.py Make sure its in a folder that does not exist/has nothing in it because if you install it in D:/py scripts for example and there is stuff in thereit will NOT make a new folder.
So after all that you are ready to install CBOS.
