# CBOS-shell
A shell I made in python with a install .exe file and source code.
Note that the code will exit when the install program finishes on windows and if you want to run it off cmd you need to install python 3 I programed it on python 3.12 so i know that it works on 3.12.
All the stuff i told you up there ONLY applies to windows because i know that linux has python built in.
I recomend just downloading the whole zip file because if you need the install.exe you need the code.txt file and if you need the install(no password) then you need the code(npass).txt
